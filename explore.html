		<h3>Objective</h3>
		<p>
		Living on the streets, you make a living out of stealing and murder. Brought up from childhood on a life of crime, you joined a gang at 16 and worked for them until recently. Recently that is, when you got arrested and sentenced to death after a bad hit-and-run job.

		The government happens to offer you a deal. To test the security of their prison. They want you to make it through their tests alive, and you may run free. Will you be able to make it through the monster-infested dungeons? 
		</p>
		<p>
		In the meantime, walk around to find objects that might help you fight, run, and get past the nasty dungeon unscathed.
